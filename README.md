---

## IaaS Resources/Tools (AWS)

**Purpose:** Provide foundational infrastructure for hosting, storage, and networking.

**AWS Services:**
- **Amazon EC2:** Virtual servers for custom backend processing and ML workloads.
- **Amazon S3:** Scalable object storage for raw sensor data and model outputs.
- **Amazon EBS:** Block storage for EC2 instances running analytics engines.
- **Amazon VPC:** Isolated network environment for secure communication.
- **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB):** Distributes traffic across EC2 instances.

---

## PaaS Resources/Tools (AWS)

**Purpose:** Simplify deployment and scaling of applications and ML models.

**AWS Services:**
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk:** Deploy and manage web applications without handling infrastructure.

## Use Case: Machine Learning for Pollution Prediction

### Most Appropriate Service Type: **PaaS**

**Why PaaS (AWS SageMaker, Lambda, API Gateway)?**
- **Rapid ML development:** SageMaker provides built-in algorithms, Jupyter notebooks, and model hosting.
- **Serverless processing:** Lambda handles real-time data ingestion and transformation.
- **Scalable APIs:** API Gateway exposes predictions to dashboards and external apps.
- **No infrastructure overhead:** Developers focus on models, not servers.

**Why not IaaS?**
- Requires manual provisioning and scaling of EC2, storage, and networking.
- Slower iteration cycles and higher maintenance burden.

**Why not SaaS?**
- SaaS tools like QuickSight are ideal for visualization, not for custom ML workflows.

## Sample Project: Pollution Spike Prediction with AWS SageMaker

**Workflow:**
1. **Data Ingestion:** IoT sensors send data to AWS IoT Core.
2. **Preprocessing:** AWS Lambda cleans and formats data.
3. **Model Training:** SageMaker trains a regression model to predict pollution spikes.
4. **Model Hosting:** SageMaker endpoint serves predictions via API Gateway.
5. **Visualization:** QuickSight dashboards display real-time predictions and trends.

**Comparison Table:**

| Service Type | Pros | Cons |
|--------------|------|------|
| IaaS (EC2, S3) | Full control, customizable | High setup and maintenance effort |
| PaaS (SageMaker, Lambda) | Fast deployment, scalable, integrated ML tools | Less control over infrastructure |
| SaaS (QuickSight, Chime) | Easy to use, no setup needed | Limited customization for ML workflows |

## Summary Report

### Comparison of AWS Service Models

| Feature | IaaS | PaaS | SaaS |
|--------|------|------|------|
| Control | High | Medium | Low |
| Setup Time | Long | Moderate | Short |
| Scalability | Manual | Automatic | Automatic |
| Use Case Fit | Infrastructure-heavy | ML and app development | Visualization and collaboration |

### Use Case Analysis

- **Machine Learning** benefits from PaaS due to integrated tools, scalability, and reduced operational overhead.
- **SageMaker** and **Lambda** streamline the entire ML lifecycle from data ingestion to deployment.

### Recommendations

- Use **PaaS** for ML development and deployment.
- Integrate **SaaS** tools like QuickSight for stakeholder reporting.
- Reserve **IaaS** for specialized workloads requiring full control.

### Architecture Overview: Pollution Prediction System on AWS

This diagram illustrates the end-to-end flow of an IoT-driven pollution prediction system built entirely on AWS cloud services. It highlights how real-time sensor data is ingested, processed, modeled, and visualized using scalable, serverless, and machine learning components.

#### Key Components:
- **Sensor Network:** IoT devices collect air quality metrics and transmit time-series data.
- **AWS IoT Core:** Securely ingests and routes sensor data.
- **AWS Lambda:** Preprocesses incoming data for storage and modeling.
- **Amazon S3:** Stores raw and cleaned datasets for training and archival.
- **Amazon SageMaker:** Trains and hosts ML models to predict pollution spikes.
- **Amazon API Gateway + Lambda:** Exposes model predictions via RESTful APIs.
- **Amazon QuickSight:** Visualizes predictions and trends for stakeholders.

#### Security & Scalability:
All components are deployed within a secure **Amazon VPC**, ensuring network isolation and compliance. Services are designed to scale automatically based on data volume and user demand.
